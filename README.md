# Pong Clone in C

## Overview
This project is a Pong clone, developed as a personal challenge to enhance my proficiency in C and to delve into the basics of game programming. With an intent to mimic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms within C, the game logic is crafted to demonstrate how structured programming can simulate OOP concepts. This endeavor not only solidifies my understanding of C but also serves as a stepping stone into the realm of game development.

## Features
- **OOP-like Structure**: Implements a pseudo-OOP architecture in C for game logic.
- **Custom Game Loop**: Features a handcrafted game loop essential for real-time game control.
- **Simple UI**: Utilizes a minimalistic user interface for clear and straightforward gameplay.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC or Clang. Additionally, this project depends on [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) for rendering graphics and handling input, as well as [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) for font rendering; ensure both are installed and correctly configured on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/devdavedevdave/pong.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd pong
```

3. Compile the project:
```
make
```
Run the game:
```
./main
```


## Controls
- **Player1**: Use the `W` and `S` arrow keys to move the paddle.
- **Player1**: Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move the paddle.
